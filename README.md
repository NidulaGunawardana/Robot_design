# EN2533 Robot Design and Competition module in third üåü My team and I navigated through a spectrum of challenges, showcasing our technical prowess and innovative solutions.

üèÅ Task Highlights:
1. **Line Following and Obstacle Avoidance:** Our robot seamlessly maneuvered through a predefined path, effortlessly tackling twists and turns while avoiding obstacles.
2. **Ramp Navigation & Box Dragging:** Witness our robot's prowess as it conquered ramps and cleared paths by intelligently dragging a box, demonstrating adaptability and problem-solving skills.
3. **Sound Detection Task:** A cutting-edge feature enabled our robot to respond to sound cues, showcasing precision in halting its movements when needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fully Equipped Robot:
Our creation boasts an array of sensors and a touch screen interface for seamless control. The incorporation of advanced technologies has rendered our robot powerful, versatile, and ready for any challenge.

### 1. Sensors
- **Aptinex Raykha S8 - Reflective Sensor Array:** Utilized for line-following task with eight IR sensors for identifying line, junctions, and checkpoints.
- **ST GY-VL53L0XV2 Time of-Flight Distance Sensor:** Seven sensors employed for wall-following task and guard robot detection.
- **48 CPR Encoder:** Regulates motor's RPM for accurate distance measurement on the ramp.
- **TCS34725 RGB Color Recognition Sensor:** Used for identifying red or blue color for subtask 4.
- **Uxcell Sound Microphone Sensor Detection Module:** Incorporated for sound detection in subtask 5.

### 2. Actuators
- **9.7:1 Metal Gearmotor 25Dx63L mm HP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder**
- **Continuous Rotation SG90 Servo Motor Plastic Wheel Full Set Normal (360 degrees)**
- **Standard 6 Volt with Metal Gear Servo Motor - 13kg (CAT.NO: YM2763)**
  
#### CAD Design of the Robot Arm
- The robot arm consists of a gripper, distance sensor, and color sensor, controlled by two servo motors.
- Gripper operated by metal geared servo motor; larger servo motor controls arm's vertical movement.
- Distance and color sensors positioned at the gripper enhance the robot's capabilities.

### 3. Batteries
- **3300mAh LiPo**

### 4. Other Components
- **TFT Touch Sensitive Display:** Integrated for selecting checkpoints.
- **25mm Castor Wheel**
- **DRV8256E Based Dual Motor Driver**
- **Buck Down Converter 5V**
- **Buck Down Converter 10V**
- **Battery Level Indicator**

#### PCB Development
- Currently developing a shield PCB for Arduino board to minimize wires and simplify mechanism.
